The first time you stepped behind a bar counter, it wasn’t because you were chasing a dream. You were running from someone. But whatever brought you there, it didn’t take long before you realized you belonged behind a bar counter. The world outside was hard, full of empty pockets and broken promises. But inside the bar, under the warm glow of hanging lamps and the low hum of a jazz record spinning in the corner, things were different. Here, people laughed, drank, and told stories like they had nothing to lose. And you? You weren’t just serving drinks. You were listening. Watching. Learning. At first, you were just another pair of hands, wiping down the counter, filling glasses, keeping your head down while the real bartenders worked. But you paid attention—to the way they moved, how they mixed without measuring, how they could read a person with just a glance and know exactly what kind of night they were having. A bartender wasn’t just someone who poured drinks. They were a storyteller, a confidant, a quiet anchor in a world that never stopped moving. So you started practicing. You learned the difference between a good drink and a great one. How a slight twist of citrus could change everything. How ice melted just slow enough to mellow out a strong pour. How some people wanted to talk, and others just wanted to forget. Then Prohibition came, and the game changed. Speakeasies flourished in the hidden corners of the city, and the bar became more than just a place to drink—it became a sanctuary, a secret world behind heavy velvet curtains and locked doors. You found yourself working in one of these underground joints, pouring bootlegged whiskey into delicate coupe glasses, learning how to keep quiet when the wrong people asked the wrong questions. You even had a hand in making the hooch yourself, distilling something halfway decent in a back room, careful not to get caught. And somewhere along the way, you stopped being just another bartender. People came to you for the perfect pour, the kind ear, the right words at the right time. You built a reputation—not just for mixing a drink, but for understanding people, for knowing what they needed before they even asked. Now, the world is shifting again. Prohibition is ending, and the city is waking up. Some of the old bars are reopening, others disappearing into history. But you? You’re still here, standing behind the bar, a master of your craft. The clink of glasses, the murmur of conversation, the slow burn of a well-made drink—it’s all second nature to you now. Because for you, this was never just a job. It was a calling. A bartender doesn’t just serve drinks—they serve moments, stories, memories. And no matter who walks through that door, no matter where they’ve been or where they’re going, you’ll be there—steady, sharp, ready with a glass and a knowing smile. Because this? This is your bar. And every night, the world stops here—if only for a little while.

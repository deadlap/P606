You never meant to spend your life waiting tables, but fate simply led you through the doors of a restaurant one day and never let you leave. But however it started, it didn’t take long before you realized that a place like this—a bustling dining room filled with the clatter of plates, the hum of conversation, the rich aroma of roasted meat and fresh bread—was more than just a job. It was a stage. And you? You were a performer. The first nights were hard. Your hands fumbled, your feet ached, and your tray felt like it was always one wrong step away from disaster. The chefs barked orders, the customers barely looked at you, and every mistake was met with a sharp glare from the head waiter. But you learned fast. You had to. You learned how to move through a crowded room without spilling a drop. How to take an order without writing it down, remembering every detail as if it were second nature. You learned which customers wanted to talk and which ones just wanted to eat in peace. You learned to read people—the tired businessmen, the young couples on first dates, the regulars who ordered the same thing every time but still wanted to be surprised. And when Prohibition came, restaurants became more than just places to eat. They were meeting spots, secret worlds tucked behind unmarked doors. You worked in one of those joints where the right knock got you into a hidden speakeasy, where cocktails were served in coffee cups and the band played just loud enough to drown out whispers of shady deals. You saw things. Heard things. Knew things. But a good waiter never gossips—at least, not to the wrong people. Then the world shifted again. Prohibition ended, and the city lit up with celebration. Fine dining returned, the jazz got louder, and suddenly, working the floor of a good restaurant wasn’t just a job—it was a career. And you? You weren’t just some kid balancing plates anymore. You were somebody. Now, you move with precision, carrying trays like they weigh nothing, taking orders with a nod and a smile. You’ve mastered the art of timing—when to approach, when to pull back, when to linger just long enough to make a customer feel important. You know which dishes will impress, which wines to recommend, and how to handle the customers who think they’re too good to say thank you. Because this isn’t just about food. It’s about people. It’s about making someone’s night better, even if it’s just for an hour. And you? You’re the unseen hand that keeps it all running. Because a good waiter doesn’t just serve meals. A good waiter orchestrates an experience. And every time you step onto the floor, you remind the world that even in the simplest of moments, there’s a touch of grace, a bit of elegance—even a little magic.

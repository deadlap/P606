You were not born into wealth. You built it. Your childhood was spent in the dust and grit of a world that never handed out fortune, only struggle. While others played, you worked. While others dreamed, you planned. You saw men break their backs for pennies, working fields that would never be theirs, answering to those who saw them as nothing more than tools. That would never be you. From an early age, you understood one simple truth—power wasn’t given, it was taken. And wealth? Wealth was buried deep in the ground, waiting for the right hands to pull it free. While others were looking at crops and cattle, you were looking deeper. You saw the land not for what it was, but for what lay beneath it. Black gold. The fuel of industry. The future. Your first well wasn’t a lucky strike. It was a calculated move. You studied the land, read the reports, listened to the whispers of those who had drilled and failed before you. And when the time came, you gambled everything—every cent you had, every favor you could call in, every ounce of sweat you were willing to spill. Then it happened. The ground rumbled, the derrick shook, and oil burst into the sky like a damn fireworks display. One strike turned into two. Two turned into an empire. You didn’t just find oil—you controlled it. You bought the land, built the rigs, and watched as the money poured in like the very oil you pulled from the earth. But money alone wasn’t enough. Not for you. Anyone could strike oil, but not everyone could hold onto it. You crushed your competition, outbid the weak, outmaneuvered the greedy. When someone tried to muscle in on your territory, you buried them in legal battles so deep they forgot which way was up. If they still didn’t get the message, well—business had a way of sorting those things out. Now, when you walk into a room, people stand. They shake your hand with smiles that don’t quite reach their eyes, because they know who you are. What you are. You don’t just own wells—you own the railroads that ship the oil, the refineries that process it, the politicians who keep the laws in your favor. The world runs on oil. And you? You run the oil. The 1930s are uncertain times for most. The economy swings like a pendulum, men lose fortunes overnight. But not you. While others worry about the future, you own the future. Every factory, every car, every war machine being built across the ocean—they all need what you have. You started with nothing. Now, you own everything. And if the world wants to keep running, it will have to come through you.
